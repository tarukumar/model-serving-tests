    "content": "Here is a simple Python code to find even numbers in a list:\n\n```python\ndef find_even_numbers(numbers):\n    even_numbers = []\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            even_numbers.append(number)\n    return even_numbers\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `find_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input. It initializes an empty list called `even_numbers` to store the even numbers. Then, it iterates through each number in the input list using a for loop. For each number, it checks if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., even) by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the number is even, it appends it to the `even_numbers` list. Finally, the function returns the `even_numbers` list.\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of numbers as an argument, and it will return a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list.",
