    "content": "Here is a simple Python code snippet to find even numbers in a list:\n\n```python\ndef find_even_numbers(numbers):\n    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n    return even_numbers\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(find_even_numbers(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `find_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division is 0, the number is even and is added to the new list.",
