      "content": "Here is a simple Python code snippet to find even numbers in a list:\n\n```python\ndef find_even_numbers(numbers):\n    even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n    return even_numbers\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nprint(find_even_numbers(numbers))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `find_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and check if each number is even (i.e., if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0). If a number is even, it is added to the `even_numbers` list. The function then returns the `even_numbers` list.\n\nIn the example usage, the function is called with a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and the resulting list of even numbers is printed to the console.",
