Here's an example:\n```\neven_numbers = (x for x in range(1, 10) if x % 2 == 0)\nprint(even_numbers)  # [2, 4, 6, 8]\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `filter()` function to filter out the even numbers:\n```\neven_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(1, 10))\nprint(even_numbers)  # [2, 4, 6, 8]\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",
